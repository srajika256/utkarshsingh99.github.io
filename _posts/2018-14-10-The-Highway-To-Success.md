### ClubComing is on a Roll!

#### 23:40

The past 3 days have been absolutely amazing considering how much work has been done rearding my big project! Okay, I accept that I'm still lagging behind schedule, but just looking back at how much I was able to accomplish in these days just makes me so proud!

I finished the login page using JWTs and Cookies, something which is just wonderful!
Then I made private routes for everything, and I have almost finished all the database queries.

Now I have to carry out the query of displaying what all clubs has the candidate applied for, and then I have to configure Kartikey's LaTeX code for my mongodb project. The latter is a tough part since I'll first have to understand his code. So I'm keeping this for later.

Before all of that, only a simple task remains and that is to make all the new routes private by adding middleware.

Oh, ofcourse, I also have to make a login page. Got to have some way to delete the tokens too!

Okay, something terrible is happening. Can't really call it confusing because even I don't have any idea what the problem is. I am running the server, running the site on my PC, everything works fine. The second I try to run the localhost site on my phone, it doesn't login!

To add to that, some weird thing has happened to the candidateProfile page too. Can't access that after adding the middleware.

Will definitely have to see what's the problem tomorrow. What a disappointing end to a brilliant day.
