### Atom customizations and shortcuts

So according to my timetable, I have to study JWTs and Security and Authentication in Node today, but I was and still am distracted by the wonderfully amazing customizations in atom. It all started with my inevitable need to learn shortcuts since my hopeless speed in coding needs to be improved.

So learning shortcuts is really important if you're into writing big codes, or if you just want to improve your coding speed.

I will just have to use this as reference always since this is so damn important


## Editing Shortcuts

| Command | macOS | Windows | Linux | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Duplicate Lines | `shift-cmd-d` | `ctrl-shift-d` | `ctrl-shift-d` | Duplicates the line of the current cursor position and creates a new line under it with the same contents |
| Delete Line | `ctrl-shift-k` | `ctrl-shift-k` | `ctrl-shift-k` | Deletes the current line |
| Move Line Up | `ctrl-cmd-up` | `ctrl-up`  | `ctrl-up` | Moves the contents of the current cursor position up one line. If there is a line above with content, the current lines content will swap with the one above it. |
| Move Line Down | `ctrl-cmd-down` | `ctrl-down`  | `ctrl-down` | Moves the contents of the current cursor position down one line. If there is a line below with content, the line's content will swap with the one below it. |
| Find/Replace | `cmd-f` | `ctrl-f`  | `ctrl-f` | Opens up the Find/Replace panel |
| Find Next | `cmd-g` | `F3`  | `F3` | Toggles forward through the results of the current buffer in the file while the Find/Replace panel is active |
| Find Previous | `shift-cmd-g` | `shift-F3`  | `shift-F3` | Toggles backward through the results of the current buffer in the file while the Find/Replace panel is active|
| Find in Project | `shift-cmd-f` | `ctrl-shift-f`  | `ctrl-shift-f` | Opens the Find in Project Panel |
| Go To Line | `ctrl-g` | `ctrl-g`  | `ctrl-g` | Opens the Go To Line panel |
| Go To Matching Bracket | `ctrl-m` | `ctrl-m`  | `ctrl-m` | The cursor goes to the matching top bracket that the cursor is ecapsulated in  |
| Select Line | `cmd-l` | `ctrl-l`  | `ctrl-l` | Selects the entire line the cursor's current position is in |
| Toggle Comment | `cmd-/` | `ctrl-/`  | `ctrl-/` | Toggles the selected text into a comment of the current grammar |
| Column Selection | `ctrl-shift-up/down` | `ctrl-alt-up/down` | `shift-alt-up/down`  | Allows to select multiple rows, where the same edit will be applied |
| Select Same Words | `cmd-d` | `ctrl-d` | `ctrl-d` | If you select a word, and then hit the key combo for this command, Atom will select the next same word for you. Then you can either type directly (which will replace the old words) or use left or right arrow to append things. |
| Undo Selection | `cmd-u` | `ctrl-u` | `ctrl-u` | This undoes the previous selection, like from Select Same Words. |
| Select All The Same Words At Once | `cmd-ctrl-g` | `alt-f3`  | `alt-f3` | This shortcut is similar to `cmd-d/ctrl-d` but it selects all the matching words at once.  |
| Show Symbols Palette | `cmd-r` | `ctrl-r` | `ctrl-r` | This shortcuts opens a palette that lists all the symbols (or functions) in your current file allowing you to fuzzy search and jump lines. |
| Show auto-completions | `ctrl-space` | `ctrl-space` | `ctrl-space` | Show available auto-completions |
| Fold/Unfold sections of code | `option-cmd-[` <b>and</b> `option-cmd-]` | `ctrl-shift-[` <b>and</b> `ctrl-shift-]` | `ctrl-shift-[` <b>and</b> `ctrl-shift-]` | Fold and Unfold sections of code
| Fold/Unfold at a specific indentation level | `cmd-k` <b>then</b> `cmd-(0-9)` | `ctrl-k` <b>then</b> `ctrl-(0-9)` | `ctrl-k` <b>then</b> `ctrl-(0-9)` | Fold/Unfold at a specific indentation level where the number is the indentation depth

Okay, hopefully, one day I can use all of them and have the ultimate debuggung speed

### Udemy Come in

Now let's start with the only module which I couldn't grasp completely in the lecture, and that is Security and Authentication. I've downloaded the first basic resource in the module and now it's time to study that code! Let's go!

##### A TO-DO to be kept in mind is that I have to learn how to use the Hydrogen package in atom. It sounds so awesome!
