### D3 Approaching

#### 17:00

There are just a couple of things left to do before I jump on to study the new library, and they are:
1. Make queries for finding what all clubs has the candidate applied to.
2. Make the LaTeX code Mongo-friendly.

#### 01:15 am - Next Day

I have finished everything. Only thing that remains is just D3.js. However, I need to make the existing project perfect.

Here is the TODO:
1. UI Finishing
2. Seeding the database so I can cross-check whether the project works fine or not.

I'll go with the second one first. I have something very interesting in mind, and that is, modifying the app that my friends have made. I'll first make a post endpoint, which I have already made, my bad, and then send a post request from the GetIntoClub app into my database. Then I'll give the app to my friends and ask them to fill out random CVs. Amazing!

Let's start with forking the project.

### Hello Again, Android Studio!

#### 01:30

Gradle build, earth's slowest production. I'm still here, waiting for my project to start. :/

#### 02:30

I've completed the requests, resolved the infinite errors that kept popping. I do feel brilliant when I think of that, but ofcourse to have the cherry on top of the cake, my app crashes. Yup, that is amazing.
I think it was mostly because I didn't start the MongoDB server, but it could be a native code error too. Well, I'll look at it tomorrow.

This is US, signing off.
