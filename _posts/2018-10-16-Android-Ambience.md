### Android Studio is back in my life!

#### 12:00

I gotta admit, no matter how many errors it throws on you, or however slow it might be while running the application, there's something that pulls you towards this highly intuitive interface and editor. Although currently, I am struggling with a swamp full of bugs and somehow just trying to find a ray of hope to send a post request.

I have tried the internet way, and somehow there is a crash in this very line:

> OutputStream outputPost = new BufferedOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());

Or this line, as I have tried alternatively,

> OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();

Okay, I found a better way! **AndroidNetworking** is a library that does exactly what I wanted. And that is, to save me the shit ton of code I was writing that I had no idea about.

So, here I am, about to test the real post request to my server.

After so many error removals, up and downs and lefts and rights, I'm finally here, with the perfect app and the not-so-perfect-but-done website of mine.

Now I need to seed this database. For that, I need to put the database for public access, precisely the endpoints in the server. And what better than the extremely famous AWS.  
So I'll be diving in AWS, learning how to host it and what to do with it, thus acquainting myself with one of the most popular things going on lately.  
I could have gone with DigitalOcean too, which regularly sends me ads about its hosting, but let's just go with the plan for now.

Okay, I'm quite confused with the choices that I have apart from AWS and I think I need to choose a proper one after understanding these in the best way possible. I'll get back at these tomorrow with a fresh mind. Will be understanding what mLab does in detail too.

This is me, signing off.
